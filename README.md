# hello-world
Here I will be uploading all my first traditional Hello World's!

Traditionally when programmers starts learning a new programming language the first thing they write is a print of the phrase "Hello World", so I want to keep this tradition. Every time I start learning a new language I will be uploading this as a recordatory of all the languages I have been in touch with during my professional experience, like a cute diary.
